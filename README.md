# GetRepoDrake

GetRepoDrake is a tool to list and easily set up community maintained repositories,
similar to easyurpmi but via web interface.

## History

Before the [Blogdrake Community Repositorio for Mandriva](http://ftp.blogdrake.net) was created in 2009, I saw the new Mandriva users have some issues to add new reposotories, so I started this proyect in the early 2010. 


You can see the first announce of the release [here](http://blogdrake.net/blog/drakor/nueva-herramienta-de-la-comunidad-disponible-getrepodrake).

Pleople of the [Blogdrake](http://Blogdrake.net) give me a great hand while I was the main mainteiner of this tool.

After a couple a years (I don't exactly remmember the date), I wasn't able to maintain this tool, so **José Alberto Valle Cid** take the challenge and  now him is on charge.
